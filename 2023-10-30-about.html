  <p class="" >Â The world of data offers incredible new opportunities to anyone who is able to understand it and manage it responsibly. In the last few years, the demand for data engineering (analytics engineering, ML engineering etc.) competences has skyrocketed, creating a huge and unaddressed skills gap.</p>
<h4 >Pipeline Academy was born to help you learn how to deal with the complex and sometimes intimidating world of data infrastructures. The course will give you an educated perspective, the practical context and the confidence to manage the data challenges of the future.</h4>
<p class="" >How can you learn the essence of this trade in three months?</p>
<p class="" >At Pipeline Academy, we're focusing on the most transformative processes to get you to be ready for solving everyday data problems, just as well as ones that don't even exist yet.

Our approach is pragmatic, transparent, collaborative and sustainable.</p>
<p class="" >You'd like to build data products that make it into production?</p>
