  <h4 >Why should I join Pipeline Academy?</h4>
<p class="" >Pipeline Academy is the first coding bootcamp offering a 12-week full-time and a 9-week part-time program for learning the trade of data engineering directly from industry experts. Get access to our <a href="https://pipelinedea.github.io/2023-10-30-curriculum.html">pioneering curriculum</a> that will enable you to learn how to solve data problems and to build the data products of the future - all this in a highly structured and <a href="https://pipelinedea.github.io/2021/07/26/how-to-teach-data-engineering.html">didactically proficient way</a>.</p>
<p class="" >Equipped with the essential know-how and a compass for navigating the ever-changing landscape of the world of software and data, you’ll have the opportunity to start a rewarding, sustainable and financially very promising career as data engineer. This competence is a great multiplier of career-potential for experts and  generalists who’d like to become leaders in the rapidly growing world of data.</p>
<h4 >What are the skills I have to focus on?</h4>
<p class="" >You’ll main responsibility as a data engineer at any company is basically providing access to data for various different purposes and being able to communicate requirements and outcomes precisely. This includes <a href="https://pipelinedea.github.io/2021/07/02/the-data-engineering-portfolio-project.html">designing, setting up and maintaining the data infrastructure (aka pipelines), integrating, consolidating and optimising databases, and making sure that all relevant stakeholders have a shared understanding on how to access and handle data</a>.</p>
<p class="" >Data engineers need to have a solid knowledge of basic software engineering principles, understand the special nature of data, but most importantly they need to have the ability to deal with different types of internal and external stakeholders who leverage the data for analytical or operational purposes. Empathy, solution-oriented analytical thinking, attention to detail and curiosity are the characteristics representative of a successful data engineer people want to work with.</p>
<h4 >How is data engineering different from data science or data analytics?</h4>
<p class="" >While data analysts deal with understanding data in a specific context and translating it into actionable insights, data scientist focus on creating and optimising complex mathematical-statistical algorithms involving computer science that are supposed to solve scientific or business problems.</p>
<p class="" >Data engineers are essentially the ones who design and build the underlying systems for their peers while keeping an eye on efficiency, performance, quality etc. Data analysts, business intelligence analysts, data scientists and data engineers usually work together in data teams, or are part of cross-functional product development teams. In order for their team members to be productive, data engineers have to have a good understanding of how data is consumed by them and what goals they are trying to achieve.</p>
<h4 >Is this an online course?</h4>
<p class="" >Yes, we are running the course live and fully online. We’ve implemented <a href="https://pipelinedea.github.io/2021/07/26/how-to-teach-data-engineering.html">a methodologically outstanding online program</a>, which makes your participation possible from anywhere close to the Central European Timezone for the full-time program (9am-5pm every workday, Berlin time), or from the Americas for the part-time program (7-11am every workday EST) or from the Asia-Pacific region (8-12pm CST). Whenever possible we offer optional slots to visit us as the campus, or organise alumni events to support our graduates.</p>
<h4 >How is sustainability integrated into the program?</h4>
<p class="" >With great power comes great responsibility. If you ask us, data engineers have the duty to <a href="https://pipelinedea.github.io/2021/01/10/sustainable-data-engineering.html">design and implement data systems that consider the environmental, financial and social impact</a> on the stakeholders they interact with. With integrating sustainability as a core value into our curriculum is based on two main goals: to equip you with the core concepts required to deliver on this promise and become even more sought-after professionals on the job market, and also to push data engineering culture to become an enabler for long-term sustainability.</p>
<h4 >How much will I make as a data engineer?</h4>
<p class="" >Data engineering salaries very strongly based on geography, sector and seniority. Based on <a href="https://pipelinedea.github.io/2020/09/22/data-engineer-salary-germany-2020.html">our extensive primary and secondary research conducted in 2020</a>  and the reports from our graduates,  as junior to mid-level data engineer you should expect a gross annual salary between €50.000-80.000 in Berlin (Germany), mostly depending on your individual skills, industry-relevant background and overall company fit. This represents a significantly higher return on investment compared to other coding bootcamp offerings focusing on much more commoditised professions within the tech sector (a junior UX/UI designer or a junior web developer will make around €32.000-36.000 ceteris paribus).</p>
<p class="" >With three to five years of professional experience, this can be increased by up to 30-40%, which shows clearly how high the demand for experienced data engineers currently is. These numbers are valid for most of Germany, however the usual adjustment according to the national regional differences in cost of living apply. Note: data engineering salaries in the US are significantly higher in comparison.</p>
<h4 >How are my chances of getting a job after the bootcamp?</h4>
<p class="" >Currently data engineers are the most in-demand professionals in the world of data. With the rising number of data sources (digital services, hardware sensors etc.), the opportunities to leverage data have grown exponentially as well, and most companies need experts to enable them to do so. Fortune 500 companies, the German ‘Mittelstand’ and tech startups are all fighting for talent right now, and there is no end in sight. According to our research, <a href="https://pipelinedea.github.io/2020/04/12/the-role-of-data-engineering-post-covid-19.html">data engineering seems to be especially resistent to the COVID-induced economic crisis</a> on top. Feel free to check out the most popular platforms and see for yourself (<a href="https://joblift.de/jobs-f%C3%BCr-Data%20Engineer">JobLift</a>, <a href="https://de.indeed.com/Jobs?l=&amp;q=data%20engineer">Indeed</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=data%20engineer">LinkedIn</a>; and make sure to check out other relevant keywords like ‘data architect’ or ‘machine learning engineer’).</p>
<h4 >What is my career in data going to look like?</h4>
<p class="" >Once you’ve graduated as a data engineer from Pipeline Academy, you’ll become part of a profession that is changing every single day. You can specialise based on an industry (e.g. ecommerce, fintech), or a specific technology (e.g. streaming, cloud services), or you can find your sweet spot in analytics engineering, system architecture or dataops… the ways towards becoming a Chief Data Officer (CDO), or a Chief Technology Officer (CTO), or a Chief Product Officer (CPO) or even CEO are endless. <a href="https://pipelinedea.github.io/2021/05/05/5-specialisations-for-data-engineers.html">Take a look at roles like Machine Learning Engineer, Data Architect or Head of Data to see the vast number of individual paths you can take</a>. All of the above however require curiosity and some discipline to stay up-to-date and ahead of the game.</p>
<h4 >HOW do I prepare to Join Pipeline Academy?</h4>
<p class="" >Most importantly, <a href="https://pipelinedea.github.io/2021/07/26/how-to-teach-data-engineering.html">we expect motivation and dedication from you</a>.
