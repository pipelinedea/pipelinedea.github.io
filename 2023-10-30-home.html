<div class="image-caption"><p class="" >I’ve chosen Pipeline Academy because I wanted to learn how to bring data products to life - from end to end. After my graduation I am totally able to apply for Data Engineering or similar positions. I know about the tools, have tried them during the course or at least know how to learn or replace the „fast-fashion“ ones amongst them.

<div class="image-caption"><p class="" >The three months of the bootcamp were the most shaping and career boosting experience I've had so far. The approach Peter and Daniel take might draw some questions at first, as it's not concentrated on constant programming exercises where you learn specific solutions to specific problems but instead it goes way beyond that […].

<div class="image-caption"><p class="" >In this course I gained so much more than the knowledge about data architecture. I learned the generic approach of how to move forward in an unknown technical field, how to tackle bugs, how to separate good products from confusing ones.

<div class="image-caption"><p class="" >After some Data Engineering classes with Daniel, I decided not use csv files or data transformations in pandas anymore. The quantity of python boiler plate code for simple stuff was reduced by 90%.
  I feel 10 years younger.

<div class="image-caption"><p class="" > I really liked the way of Daniel’s in-depth explanation with so much live examples and cases that give you an idea of how different problems can be solved in different scenarios. I learned so much and this definitely gave me the push I needed to explore new territories of DE. I would highly recommend anyone who wants to start their career as Data Engineer.

<div class="image-caption"><p class="" > As someone who has taught data science for a while, the most impressive thing was the simplicity of the stack. It is very easy when teaching to complicate things for students, or to teach complex tools that confuse more than help.
