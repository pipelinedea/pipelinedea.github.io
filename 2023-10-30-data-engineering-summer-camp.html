A data engineering crash course teaching you how to build a data product within a week<br>
<br>
The camp happens between May 18-22th (Mon-Fri) 9-17h with 8 people (invite only) in a live remote classroom setting via Zoom and Slack. It’s for data analysts, software engineers, and data scientists who'd like to amp up their data engineering skills. It’s organized by <a href="https://pipelinedea.github.io/2023-10-30-about.html">Daniel &amp; Peter</a>…<br>
<br>
… and it’s for FREE.<br>

What do you get out of this?<br>
<br>
Build your own presentable data product within a week (E2E)<br>
Gain a practical overview of data engineering processes and landscape, experience the role of a data engineer in various contexts<br>
Learn from a renowned industry expert in an open and engaging environment<br>
Expand your skillset and level up your career<br>
<br>
Data engineering is one of the disciplines within tech that seems to remain very strong even during the current pandemic, and we anticipate a rising demand for this skillset once the worst is over. With our current initiative, we intend to support businesses and individuals to get access to or improve their competences through a very practical sample of what we've experienced throughout the last 10+ years of our professional careers. This is the way we believe we can support the best way during the pandemic.<br>
<br>
Why are we doing this?<br>
<br>
Where is the catch?<br>
<br>
The only thing we'd like to ask from you in exchange: feedback. Our goal is to create and transfer expertise that you can apply in your everyday data processes, and we would like to understand if we've achieved this, whether we're on the right track. It's a major step towards validating our idea about setting up the world's first coding boot camp for data engineering (and data ops).<br>
