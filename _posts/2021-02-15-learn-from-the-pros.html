<div class="sqs-html-content">  <p class="sqsrte-large" >While following the core <a href="https://www.dataengineering.academy/curriculum">12-week curriculum</a> of the data engineering bootcamp, (almost) every Thursday a selected guest speaker will share their experience on the latest domain that’s being covered, and they will be available for AMA for our students: team structures, tech stacks, hiring processes and the future of the trade - no stone will remain unturned.</p>
<p class="" >Data engineering feels like a black box for a lot of people even after spending some time with the subject matter, and I have to admit, it can be difficult to imagine the everyday life of a data professional. That is why we’ve invited some experienced practitioners to our (currently virtual) campus: our participants will have an opportunity to learn how they can put their knowledge to use, and see how others have built their careers on competences in the intersection of data and software engineering.</p>
<p class="" >We’ll have freelancers who are enjoying working remotely, industry veterans who are on the lookout for new talent for their teams, subject matter experts who have designed our built significant parts of the digital products all of us use on a daily basis… and so on. It’s a very diverse list of perspectives.</p>
<p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true" ></p>
<p class="" >Without any further ado, please check out the list of guest speakers for our very first cohort (in order of proposed appearance):</p>
