  <p class="sqsrte-large" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We’ve spent 2021 literally in a garage. Well, ok, <a href="https://www.dataengineering.academy/pipeline-data-engineering-academy-blog/the-campus">it’s not a garage anymore, but the campus of CIEE</a>. After our time there (which was really fun) we’ve finally moved into our own office only a couple of streets away.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Welcome to Schönleinstraße 4, Pipeline Academy’s new home. This is the address for whenever our participants, clients or alumni are visiting us. You’ll see the walls of this place in some of the Zoom calls we’re involved in as well.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">IMAGE</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Yes, we’re located right above the barber shop.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In a world where remote work is becoming the norm, there is still demand for places of work where employees can socialise, meet their peers and their mentors, and build up an understanding for the vision and culture of an organisation. You, just like our participants have a personal preference for where you’d like to spend your working hours. Yet especially in this time of turmoil, the special quality of direct personal interactions gain importance. We’re not any different.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What does this mean for you?</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Well, now that we have a kitchen Daniel can use it for cooking. He already deployed his pressure cooker, so expect shenanigans.</p>
