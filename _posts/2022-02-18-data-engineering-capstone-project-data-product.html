<div class="sqs-html-content">  <p class="sqsrte-large" >Data engineers have to wear many different hats at the same time: they are architects, designers, builders, maintainers, procurement and quality assurance — to just name a few. If you’d like to break into this profession, you need to prove that you can do all of the above, and more.</p>
<p class="" >One of the key assets you can use to do that is a data product that you’ve built with your own hands. Last summer we’ve already covered the expectations towards a portfolio project in detail, focusing on a general outline and approach. Take a good look: </p>

<p class="" >If you’ve never built a data stack from scratch, it’s difficult to imagine how it’s done. Especially when you face a timeline of 12 days total without any real buffers.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content">  <p class="" >Meanwhile, we see the following patterns emerge:</p>
<ul data-rte-list="default">
<li><p class="" >some participants come with a clear project idea, they would like to put a machine learning model into production, or would like to revamp the supporting infrastructure.</p></li>
<li><p class="" >some come with a data stack problem that they are currently facing at work, and they need professional guidance and clarity about how to go about solving it.</p></li>
<li><p class="" >furthermore - and this might be the most frequent setup - some people come without any clue about what they really wan’t to build. And that’s totally fine.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="" >Below you can find seven outstanding examples for the capstone projects of our alumni. They include air quality monitoring IoT solutions, maps for tracking invasive species in Europe, a Billboard chart for the hottest NFTs and so much more… </p>
<p class="" >They are a great showcase of what you can do with the technologies you learn in our course. Without any further ado, here’s a short list of the projects and products our graduates have built during 2021.</p>
