<div class="sqs-html-content">  <p class="sqsrte-large" >It’s time to share some important news with you: we’re taking time off to focus on our health and families, the launch of new data engineering cohorts is on hold until further notice.</p>
<h4 >Health and family</h4>
<p class="" >Running a bootstrapped company in times of repeated economic crises and data industry vibe shifts is a gift and a curse at the same time. No surprises here: it can be highly rewarding and joyful, but it can be exhausting and stressful as well. It’s June 2022; after two and a half years of pioneering the data engineering and data architecture education, and after celebrating multiple amazing cohorts of freshly minted data infrastructure experts, it’s time for Daniel and myself to turn the heat down and allow ourselves to recharge our batteries.</p>
<h4 >Not a “Goodbye", but hopefully a “See you soon!”</h4>
<p class="" >The current economic shift will continue to have major (and hopefully sobering) impact on the way data infrastructure and data teams are managed, so challenges in this space are abundant. If you’re looking to become the data architect who can make sense of the promises of the “modern data stack”, who can design, build and maintain data infra that just works, and who understands what really matters and what doesn’t, you’re still at the right spot.</p>
<p class="" >If you’d like to get in touch, feel free to <a href="mailto:info@dataengineering.academy">email us directly</a>, or if you’d like to be notified when a new cohort launches, please sign up here.</p>
<p class="" >If you are looking for trainings for your organisation or partner up, just send us an <a href="mailto:info@dataengineering.academy">email</a>.</p>

<p class="" >We hope to see you soon,<br>Peter &amp; Daniel</p>
