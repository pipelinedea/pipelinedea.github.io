  <p class="sqsrte-large" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Daniel and I had the opportunity to sit down and have a chat again with Tobias Macey from the Data Engineering Podcast. His show is a mainstay in the data engineering community, and it was a pleasure to revisit the events of the last 8 months together with him. <a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/pipeline-data-engineering-academy-retrospective-episode-198/">Listen to the episode right here!</a><br></p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">While <a href="https://www.dataengineering.academy/pipeline-data-engineering-academy-blog/data-engineering-podcast-pipeline-academy">Daniel’s first appearance on the show from September 2020</a> was more about our very specific approach to solving engineering problems and turning this into a curriculum and a proper learning concept, and other future plans, this time we mostly speak in past tense.</p>
<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We’ve talked about what launching Pipeline Academy felt like and we’ve shared some insights about the experiences of our founding cohort. <a href="https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/pipeline-data-engineering-academy-retrospective-episode-198/">Highlights, proud moments, challenges, lessons learned, takeaways for the future — you name it, it’s all in there</a>. This episode is especially recommended for people who are considering joining a bootcamp and/or learning data engineering, and for the ones amongst you who are asking themselves why context, code and confidence are so important in order to get started in the universe of data and software engineering.</p>
