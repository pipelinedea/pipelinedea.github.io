<div class="sqs-html-content">  <p class="sqsrte-large" >Finalists and winners for <a href="https://www.edtechdigest.com">The EdTech Awards 2022</a> have been announced to a worldwide audience of educators, technologists, students, parents, and policymakers interested in building a better future for learners and leaders in the education and workforce sectors. </p>
<p class="" >The EdTech Awards were established in 2010 to recognise, acknowledge, and celebrate the most exceptional innovators, leaders, and trendsetters in education technology. Celebrating its 12th year, the US-based program is the world's largest recognition program for education technology, recognising the biggest names in edtech – and those who soon will be.</p>
<p class="" ><a href="https://www.edtechdigest.com/2022-finalists-winners/">This year’s finalists and winners</a> were narrowed from the larger field and judged based on various criteria, including: pedagogical workability, efficacy and results, support, clarity, value and potential.  </p>
<h4 >I am absolutely delighted to announce that our work has been recognised in two categories this year:</h4>

<div class="sqs-html-content">  <p class="" >"As events unfold on the world stage that seem to inch ever closer to a precipice unknown, we are reminded that the leaders and innovators of education technology have always worked on the edge," said Victor Rivero, who as Editor-in-Chief of EdTech Digest, oversees the program. </p>
<p class="" >"The future-focused work they do is inspired by the infinite potential of all people to learn and thrive. It's pushed forward by the human spirit. It's the light that even through the darkest times always shines through," Rivero said.</p>
<h4 >On behalf of everyone who has been supporting the work of Pipeline Academy, we’d like to  say thank you for this recognition. It is proof that our efforts for making the education landscape a more transparent and future-proof place for learners does not go unnoticed by the broader innovation ecosystem.</h4>
