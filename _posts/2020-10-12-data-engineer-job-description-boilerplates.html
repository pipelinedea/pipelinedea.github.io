<div class="sqs-html-content">  <p class="sqsrte-large" >Are you an HR-professional recruiting new members for your organisationâ€™s data team? If you are looking for talent to fill a data engineer role, you have probably faced the challenge of writing a proper job description. Your CTO/Director of Engineering/Head of Data is very busy, and gave you only some high-level points, but nothing that fits into a JD. Don't worry, you are not alone.</p>
<p class="" >Below you can find some boilerplate wording for the 'Tasks &amp; Responsibilities' section of a data engineer job description. Adjust, adapt and complete it the way you see fit, the point is really to make you think less about the wording and more about finding the right person for the job. </p>
<p class="" >One hint: be selective in what you write into the job ad, more does not equal better in this case.</p>
