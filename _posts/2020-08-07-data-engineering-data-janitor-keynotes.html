<div class="sqs-html-content">  <p class="sqsrte-large" >I don't like to talk. I don't like to talk at conferences. I'm an introvert at heart. Still, sometimes one has to step out of the comfort zone and stand for things that deserve to be stood for. All my talks were born this way, some more technical, some more reflective on the practicalities of data life.</p>

<p class="" >In 2016, at <a href="https://berlinbuzzwords.de/">Berlin Buzzwords</a> in Berlin I shared our journey of how we migrated a data stack from AWS to Azure. How we managed to do it with open sourcing tools as roadkills and what weâ€™ve learnt about the barebone necessities ending up within the sole body of a Raspberry Pi may shock the absolute believers of distributed computing. An adventure in bash, make and SQL with a detour in Moore's law and falling memory prices. You can find the slides <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/soobrosa/migrating-a-data-stack-from-aws-to-azure-via-raspberry-pi">right here</a>.</p>
